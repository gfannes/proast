#### Model
Maybe a functional and non-functional design would be better than architectural and design
Or simply use the `system/design` folder without more hierarchy
### Architecture (structure)
Architecture is on a higher level than design, and more hierarchical in nature
Partitions the solution in major regions of functionality, interface, protocols, ...
Decisions that are difficult to change later
Architecture is a plan for the structure of something
### Design
Design is a plan on how to create something
Clarifies _how_ the architectural decisions will be used to achieve the requirements
TODO: try to merge architecture and design, or create a clear distinction between them
